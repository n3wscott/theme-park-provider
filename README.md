# Theme Park Provider

Learning how to use the Crossplane Provider API.

Following https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/main/contributing/guide-provider-development.md

Issues:
 - [ ] Code generation following the guide did not work out as documented.
 - [ ] go.mod tools directive is new and should be used instead of what is documented for `angryjet`
 - [ ] It is harder to not generate the controller with kubebuilder and then wire up the new controller.
 - [ ] A provider is assumed to represent a remote resource but this is not the case for what I happen to be doing.
