## Next Steps for Further Simplification

While we've removed controller-runtime and the manager from the main entry point, we still have some controller-runtime dependencies in our reconcilers. Here's how we could further simplify the implementation:

### 1. Remove SetupWithGRPC Method

The `SetupWithGRPC` method in each reconciler is still using controller-runtime and creating controllers. This is only needed for the controller side of Crossplane, not for the provider side.

For a true standalone gRPC provider, you only need:
- The `ConnectorWrapper` implementation
- The `connector` implementation
- The `external` client implementation

### 2. Create Direct Registration API

Instead of relying on SetupWith* methods, providers could directly register their handlers with the gRPC server:

```go
// Example simplified registration in main.go
builder.RegisterHandler(
    themeparkn3wscottcomv1alpha1.RideGroupVersionKind,
    &ride.ConnectorWrapper{},
)
```

### 3. Remove Controller-Runtime Dependencies

The current provider implementation still has dependencies on:
- controller-runtime logging
- controller-runtime client
- manager setup code

These could be replaced with:
- Standard klog logging (as we've already started to do)
- A minimal client interface specific to provider needs
- Direct gRPC server registration without controller setup

### 4. Separate Client and Server Packages

To make the separation clearer, we could reorganize the code into:
- `pkg/server` - Contains only the provider server implementation
- `pkg/client` - Contains the controller-side client implementation
- `pkg/reconciler` - Contains the shared reconciler logic that both sides use

### Example Implementation

A fully simplified provider would look like:

```go
// main.go
func main() {
    // Setup gRPC server
    server, err := remote.NewProviderServer(scheme)
    
    // Register handlers directly
    server.RegisterHandler(v1alpha1.RideGroupVersionKind, &ride.ExternalConnector{})
    server.RegisterHandler(v1alpha1.RideOperatorGroupVersionKind, &rideoperator.ExternalConnector{})
    
    // Start server
    server.Serve(":50051")
}
```

By removing the controller-runtime dependencies entirely, we can make the provider much more lightweight and focused solely on implementing the external resource management logic.
